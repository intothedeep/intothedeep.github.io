# ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration

No, you **do not always** have to provide generateStaticParams for static generation in Next.js App Router. However, whether you need it depends on how you want your pages to be generated. Let’s break it down:

---

**✅ When generateStaticParams is Required**

You **must** use generateStaticParams if:

1. You want **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for **dynamic routes** (e.g., /blog/[...slugs]).

2. You need to **pre-build specific paths** at build time.

3. You are using **fetch without cache: 'no-store'**, and you want the fetched data to be pre-built into static HTML.

---

**❌ When generateStaticParams is NOT Required**

You **do NOT need** generateStaticParams if:

1. The route is completely **static** (i.e., no params required).

2. You use **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** by marking the component as **async** and fetching data dynamically inside Page().

3. You use **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** (revalidate option).

4. The route **only serves dynamic content** and doesn’t need pre-generated paths.

---

**✅ Alternative Approach (SSG without generateStaticParams)**

If you **don’t** provide generateStaticParams, Next.js will fallback to **dynamic rendering**. Instead of pre-building, it will serve pages dynamically.

**Example: Dynamic Rendering (SSR)**

```
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slugs: string[] } }) {
    return (
        <main className={clsx('mt-20')}>
            <h1>{params.slugs?.join(" > ") || "No slugs provided"}</h1>
        </main>
    );
}
```

• No generateStaticParams → **Next.js dynamically renders the page at runtime**.

---

**✅ Alternative Approach (ISR for Hybrid Behavior)**

If you want to **partially** pre-render pages but allow new paths without rebuilding the whole site, you can use ISR (revalidate).

**Example: ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**

```
export async function generateStaticParams() {
    return [{ slugs: ['test-article'] }];
}

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slugs: string[] } }) {
    return (
        <main className={clsx('mt-20')}>
            <h1>{params.slugs?.join(" > ")}</h1>
        </main>
    );
}

// ISR: Regenerate page every 60 seconds
export const revalidate = 60;
```

• Pre-builds ["test-article"].

• New pages are **generated on demand** and **cached for 60 seconds**.

**🚀 Summary: Do You Need generateStaticParams?**

| **Scenario**                    | generateStaticParams **Needed?** | **Notes**                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-build all known paths (SSG) | ✅ Yes                           | Ensures static generation for specific paths. |
| Fully dynamic pages (SSR)       | ❌ No                            | Pages are rendered at request time.           |
| Hybrid (ISR)                    | ✅ Yes                           | Pre-build some, generate others on demand.    |
| Fully static page (no params)   | ❌ No                            | No need if there are no dynamic params.       |

If your goal is **a fully static site** with dynamic routes, then **yes, you should use generateStaticParams**. Otherwise, Next.js will dynamically render it using SSR.
