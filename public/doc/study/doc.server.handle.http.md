# How request a server can handle with 1CPU 1GB and 2GB memory

The number of requests a server can handle with **1 CPU, 1GB, or 2GB memory** in a **Linux environment** depends on
multiple factors, including:

â€¢    **Type of Workload**: CPU-bound (e.g., heavy computations) vs. I/O-bound (e.g., network requests, database
queries).

â€¢    **Concurrency Model**: Thread-based, event-driven, or async I/O.

â€¢    **Application Stack**: Web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Node.js, etc.), database usage, caching, etc.

â€¢    **Optimization**: Efficient use of resources, load balancing, caching, etc.

**1. General Estimation**

Assuming a simple **HTTP API server** handling lightweight requests (e.g., JSON processing, small database queries), we
can estimate:

| **Spec**       | **Lightweight API Requests per Second (RPS)** |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1 CPU, 1GB RAM | ~50-500 RPS (depending on efficiency)         |
| 1 CPU, 2GB RAM | ~100-1000 RPS (better caching and buffering)  |

â€¢    **CPU-Bound Tasks (e.g., complex calculations, AI inference)** â†’ Few requests per second (depends on processing
time).

â€¢    **I/O-Bound Tasks (e.g., database queries, HTTP requests)** â†’ Much higher throughput if optimized (async, caching,
load balancing).

**2. Key Factors Affecting Performance**

**(1) Web Server Choice**

â€¢    **Nginx** (event-driven, efficient) â†’ Higher throughput

â€¢    **Apache** (thread-based, higher memory usage) â†’ Lower throughput

â€¢    **Node.js, Python (FastAPI), Go, Rust** â†’ Can handle high concurrency with event-driven models

**(2) Concurrency Model**

â€¢    **Thread-based** (e.g., Java, Python threads) â†’ Limited by memory/thread overhead

â€¢    **Async/Event-driven** (e.g., Node.js, Go, Rust) â†’ Higher efficiency in handling I/O

**(3) Network & Database Bottlenecks**

â€¢ If requests require DB queries, disk I/O, or external API calls â†’ latency increases, reducing throughput.

â€¢ Using **caching (Redis, Memcached)** can significantly improve performance.

**3. Testing & Benchmarking**

To determine the actual performance:

â€¢ Use **Apache Bench (ab)** or **wrk**:

```
wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s http://your-server.com/
```

â€¢    **Monitor resource usage** with htop, vmstat, iostat.

â€¢    **Optimize**: Reduce memory footprint, use async processing, leverage caching.

**4. Real-World Example**

If you run a **FastAPI or Node.js** server with async DB queries and caching, you can handle **~500-1000 RPS** on 1
CPU & 2GB RAM. But for heavy computation (e.g., AI inference), it may drop to **1-10 RPS**.
